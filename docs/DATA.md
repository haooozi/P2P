# Dataset Preparation

## KITTI

+ Download the data for [velodyne](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_tracking_velodyne.zip), [calib](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_tracking_calib.zip) and [label_02](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_tracking_label_2.zip) from [KITTI Tracking](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_tracking.php).
+ Unzip the downloaded files.
+ Put the unzipped files under the same folder as following.
  ```
  [Parent Folder]
  --> [calib]
      --> {0000-0020}.txt
  --> [label_02]
      --> {0000-0020}.txt
  --> [velodyne]
      --> [0000-0020] folders with velodynes .bin files
  ```

## NuScenes

+ Download the dataset from the [download page](https://www.nuscenes.org/download)
+ Extract the downloaded files and make sure you have the following structure:
  ```
  [Parent Folder]
    samples	-	Sensor data for keyframes.
    sweeps	-	Sensor data for intermediate frames.
    maps	        -	Folder for all map files: rasterized .png images and vectorized .json files.
    v1.0-*	-	JSON tables that include all the meta data and annotations. Each split (trainval, test, mini) is provided in a separate folder.
  ```
>Note: We use the **train_track** split to train our model and test it with the **val** split. Both splits are officially provided by NuScenes. During testing, we ignore the sequences where there is no point in the first given bbox.

## Waymo Open Dataset

+ We follow the benchmark created by [LiDAR-SOT](https://github.com/TuSimple/LiDAR_SOT) based on the waymo open dataset. You can download and process the waymo dataset as guided by [LiDAR_SOT](https://github.com/TuSimple/LiDAR_SOT), and use our code to test model performance on this benchmark.
+ The following processing results are necessary
   ```
    [waymo_sot]
        [benchmark]
            [validation]
                [vehicle]
                    bench_list.json
                    easy.json
                    medium.json
                    hard.json
                [pedestrian]
                    bench_list.json
                    easy.json
                    medium.json
                    hard.json
        [pc]
            [raw_pc]
                Here are some segment.npz files containing raw point cloud data
        [gt_info]
            Here are some segment.npz files containing tracklet and bbox data 
    ```
